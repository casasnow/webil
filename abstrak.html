<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><i>In this year's IL assignment, we were given the assignment to practice selling. This IL assignment covers various subjects, which have their own role in the final assessment of the ninth grade. Lessons related to the IL project this time includes Indonesian, Mathematics, Social Studies, Science, Civics, ICT, Arts and Culture, Physical Education, Crafts, Religion, and English. Of the various lessons, there were some lessons that required us to cook, there were also lessons that required us to make advertisements, and in the end the bazaar event itself was completed. Some lessons that require us to cook are science and crafts.<i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in;"><i>In science lessons, the topic that we use for IL is Biotechnology, where biotechnology itself is a subtopic that studies the use of living things and products from living things in the production process to produce goods and services that can be used by humans. In short, the way biotechnology works is, for example, using bacteria to make a new product, or carrying out fermentation, and so on. We were asked to make a biotechnology product, which we will later sell in the form of food. Before we decided on the product we wanted to make, of course we had searched for reference sources on the internet, and we also knew about various kinds of biotechnology products, namely tempeh, kombucha, kimchi, and so on.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in;"><i>Of the various biotechnology products that we can make, we wanted to choose butter as our product, but we thought it was not possible to make it. After that, we also hesitated about choosing kombucha and kimchi as our products because we thought that not many people would like these two products. In the end, after some consideration, we chose to make cheese. We chose to make cheese because the product is quite simple, and several of our members have also tried making it, so they already have quite a good experience. When testing biotechnology at school, we carried it out quite well, and we were also quite satisfied with the products. The implementation time is not too long, only the pressing part to separate the cheese itself from the remaining milk takes a little time to do. In the process of making biotechnology products on the day, we experienced failure, because one of the processes that had to be carried out was not carried out perfectly. However, because we brought some spare materials, we were able to repeat the process, so we could produce a product that was quite good and in accordance with our plans.

 <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in;"><i>In the Crafts lesson, we were also asked to cook. The material this time is about fisheries and livestock. We were asked to make food products based on fisheries and livestock. We will later sell this product at our IL bazaar. At first, we had a little difficulty in determining the product we would make. In the end, we chose to make salmon and kani onigiri, as well as tuna onigiri. The planning process that we carried out went smoothly, and the trial process also went smoothly, so that even on the day of the bazaar, we were able to make onigiri according to our plans.
